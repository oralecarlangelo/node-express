# Node

Short project description

## Requirements

- Node.js (version X.X.X)
- MySQL (version X.X.X)
- Docker (optional)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd project-directory
npm install
```

3. Set up the database:

- Create a MySQL database.
- Update the database configuration in config/database.js with your database credentials.

4. Run database migrations:

```bash
npm run migrate
```

This will create the necessary database tables.

5. Start the server:

```bash
npm start

```

The server should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

## Development Workflow

- npm start: Start the server.
- npm run dev: Start the server with nodemon for automatic reloading during development.
- npm run migrate: Run database migrations to create/update tables.
- npm run seed: Run database seeders to populate the database with initial data.
- npm test: Run tests.

## Project Components

### Migration

Migrations are used to manage database schema changes. When you need to modify the database structure, create a new migration file using the following command:

```bash
npm run create-migration migration-name

```

This will create a new migration file in the src/migrations directory. Update the migration file to define your desired database schema changes.

### Model

Models represent the data structure of your application. They define the tables and relationships in your database. To create a new model, use the following command:

```bash
npm run create-model model-name

```

This will create a new model file in the src/models directory. Update the model definition with your desired schema.

### Controller

Controllers handle incoming requests, perform the necessary business logic, and generate responses. To create a new controller, use the following command:

```bash
npm run create-controller controller-name
```

This will create a new controller file in the src/controllers directory. Implement your desired logic in the controller methods.

### Routes

Routes define the API endpoints and map them to the corresponding controller methods. To create a new set of routes, create a new file in the src/routes directory. Define your routes using Express Router and import the corresponding controller methods.

### Validator

Validators are used to validate incoming request data. To create a new validator, use the following command:

```bash
npm run create-validator validator-name

```

This will create a new validator file in the src/validators directory. Implement your validation logic using a library like class-validator.

### Middleware

Middleware functions are used to add additional functionality to the request-response cycle. To create a new middleware, use the following command:

```bash
npm run create-middleware middleware-name

```

This will create a new middleware file in the src/middleware directory. Implement your middleware logic.

### Service

Services handle the business logic of your application. They encapsulate the core functionality and interact with models and external dependencies. To create a new service, use the following command:

```bash
npm run create-service service-name

```

This will create a new service file in the src/services directory. Implement your service logic.

## How Components Work Together

1. When an incoming request hits a specific route, the corresponding route handler in the controller is invoked.
2. The controller method retrieves any necessary data from the request, performs any required validation using validators, and calls the appropriate service methods.
3. The service methods interact with the models to fetch or manipulate data from the database.
4. The models represent the structure of the database tables and handle the database operations using an ORM like Sequelize.
5. Once the service methods have completed their tasks, they return the necessary data back to the controller.
6. The controller prepares the response, including any necessary transformations or formatting, and sends it back to the client.
